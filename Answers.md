1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    React JS is a JavaScript library that is used to build dynamic user interfaces. React JS is special because it literally "reacts" to changes in the DOM. React JS is valuable because it solves the problem of managing complex "state" on a web page.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    Thinking "in React" means to use data to visualize and drive your views when envisioning the layout and structure of a web app.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a
    Functional/Presentational component.

    Class components and functional components are similar because they are both referenced with JSX and the way in which the data of 'props' flows is the same (top down). However, class components differ from 
    functional components because the constructor function (on the class component) can receive 'props' as an argument. 


4.  Describe state.

    "State" is similar to "props" because it can be passed around, but it is essentially an object on the constructor of a class component. Objects with "state" have are mutable, unlike "props". 

5.  Describe props.

    "Props" are properties, essentially HTML attributes, that we can pass in to customize each custom-made component. Props must be inherited and are immutable.
